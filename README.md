# Dog Vision

## About this repository
This is the source code for dog vision, which contains:
* The Machine Learning (h5) file
* Jupyter Notebook which contains the documentation for training the machine learning model
* HTML, CSS and JavaScript files
* Python file for the backend

Python Virtual Environment (env) is not included because it is too big (looking at you, TensorFlow)
and requirements.txt is the one that installs all the dependencies. So leave the env behind when pushing to GitHub.

##  What is Dog Vision?
Dog vision is a website created using Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript which uses Machine Learning to
figure out what kind of breed is a dog. There are 120 different breeds that are listed.

Simply upload a picture of a dog you want, and we'll try to guess!

### DISCLAIMER: The predictions are not guaranteed to work well with mixed breeds. Predictions are made based on how similar they are mathematically to a breed in the database.
